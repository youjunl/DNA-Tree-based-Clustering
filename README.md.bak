# DNA Tree based Clustering
## About this project
This project contains code and benchmark results used in my Master thesis "Clustering for DNA Storage". The idea was developed from the tree based clustering algorithm Clover. And the this project provides both Python and C++ implementation for our clustering method.

## How to use
A read file in TXT format is needed for clustering, and each line should be like:
```shell
[Label] [Read]
```
For example:
```shell
1 ATAAGGG
2 AAAAGGG
3 AAAAGGG
4 GGACCTA
5 GGACCTA
...
```

Run the clustering with command:
```shell
python -m clust.main -I [input file] -O [output file]
```
For example:
```shell
# test data
python -m clust.main -I testdata/toClust.txt -O output_file
```

The output of the clustering result consists of original label and the label of cluster assigned, 
```shell
[Label],[Label of cluster]
```
for example:
```shell
1,1
2,1
3,1
4,2
5,2
...
```
For comparing the clustering result, a TXT file that indeicates accuracte clustering index is need:
```shell
[Label],[Label of cluster]
```
for example:
```shell
1,1
2,1
3,1
4,2
5,2
...
```

Two different metrics can be computed with commands:
```shell
python tools/computeAcc.py [Accurate indexes] [Cluster result 1] [Cluster result 2] ... [Output file]
python tools/computePur.py [Accurate indexes] [Cluster result 1] [Cluster result 2] ... [Output file]
```
For example:
```shell
python tools/computeAcc.py testdata/toClust.txt output_file_1.txt output_file_2.txt CompareResults.txt
```
